    "#### You can turn a word into pig-Latin using the following two rules (simplified): If the word starts with a consonant, move that letter to the end and append 'ay'. For example, 'happy' becomes 'appyhay' and 'pencil' becomes 'encilpay'.  If the word starts with a vowel, simply append 'way' to the end of the word. For example, 'enter' becomes 'enterway' and 'other' becomes 'otherway' . For our purposes, there are 5 vowels: a, e, i, o, u (so we count y as a consonant). Write a function pig() that takes a word (i.e., a string) as input and returns its pig- Latin form. Your function should still work if the input word contains upper case characters. Your output should always be lower case however. \n",

If the process is successful, no one but the intended recipient can understand the encrypted message. Cryptanalysis refers to attempts to undo the encryption, even if some details of the encryption are unknown (for example, if an encrypted message has been intercepted). The first step of cryptanalysis is often to build up a table of letter frequencies in the encrypted text. Assume that the string letters is already defined as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
